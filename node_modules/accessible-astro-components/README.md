# Accessible Astro Components
A set of Accessible, easy to use, Front-end UI Components for [Astro](https://astro.build/). Most of these components are used in the [Accessible Astro Starter](https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-starter) and the [Accessible Astro Dashboard](https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-dashboard) themes and they provide exemplary use cases for these components. As a bonus, these themes also have their own dedicated components (like keyboard accessible and responsive navigations) and many **Design System** utility classes, patterns and primatives (such as grids, buttons, lists, spacings, sizes and more).

```jsx
---
import { Accordion, AccordionItem, Card, Modal, ... } from 'accessible-astro-components'
---
```

**Skip to**: [Accordion](#Accordion), [Breadcrumbs](#Breadcrumbs), [Card](#card), [DarkMode](#DarkMode), [Media](#Media), [Modal](#Modal), [Notification](#Notification), [Pagination](#Pagination), [SkipLinks](#SkipLinks)

### Accordion

- [When (not) to use](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordions-complex-content/)

Accordions are great from grouping big chunks of content into easer to scan headers which the user can expand when he or she wants to read what is associated with that header.

**Some (accessibility) features of the Accordion**:
- Navigation the AccordionItems using the <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd> and <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd> keys
- Closing an opened AccordionItem using the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key
- Helps identify content to screen reader users with `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-expanded`
- Using an unordered list structure to tell screen readers users how many items there are and which they are currently on

#### Example

```jsx
---
import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from 'accessible-astro-components'
---
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem
    header="First Item"
  >
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Architecto quasi nobis optio? Qui in quo accusantium debitis sapiente obcaecati magnam incidunt sit. Molestiae exercitationem quibusdam quod veritatis laboriosam est tenetur. </p>
    <a href="#">Tab to me!</a>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem
    header="Second Item"
  >
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Architecto quasi nobis optio? Qui in quo accusantium debitis sapiente obcaecati magnam incidunt sit. Molestiae exercitationem quibusdam quod veritatis laboriosam est tenetur. </p>
  </AccordionItem>

  <!-- ... -->

</Accordion>
```

#### Overwriting styles
You can apply your own styles by either setting the individual properties using `:global(body .accordion__item)` for example, or set up a global style tag and define your styles in there:

```scss
<style lang="scss" is:global>
  body .accordion__item {
    button {
      background-color: purple;

      &:hover
      &:focus {
        background-color: peru;
      }
    }

    &.is-active button {
      background-color: peru;
    }
  }
</style>
```

### Breadcrumbs

- [When (not) to use](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/breadcrumbs/)

Breadcrumbs are a great way to help users navigate back to a previous page or section. They are also a great way to help screen reader users understand where they are in the website.

**Some (accessibility) features of the Breadcrumbs**:
- Helps identify content to screen reader users with `aria-label="Breadcrumbs"`
- Using an unordered list structure to tell screen readers users how many items there are and which they are currently on
- Using a `<nav>` element to tell screen readers users that this is a navigation element

#### Example

```jsx
---
import { Breadcrumbs, BreadcrumbsItem } from 'accessible-astro-components'
---
<Breadcrumbs>
  <BreadcrumbsItem 
    href="/"
    label="Home"
  />
  <BreadcrumbsItem
    href="/blog"
    label="Blog"
  />
  <BreadcrumbsItem
    currentPage={true}
    label="My blog post"
  />
</Breadcrumbs>
```

#### Overwriting styles
You can apply your own styles by either setting the individual properties using `:global(body .breadcrumbs__item)` for example, or set up a global style tag and define your styles in there:

```scss
<style lang="scss" is:global>
  body .breadcrumbs__item {
    li::after {
      content: '>';
    }
  }
</style>
```

### Card

Cards are usually used in groups. By wrapping them in an unordered list we provide screen reader users with shortcuts to lists and list items. Screen readers also let the users know how many items there are in a list. In the example below you'll find the structure using an unordered list and `display: grid`, making sure we leave enough of a gap between Cards on touch devices for people who find they have low accuracy when targeting items, including those with Parkinson's disease and rheumatism. Leaving a bigger gap makes it easer to scroll without accidentally activating a Cards link.

**Some (accessibility) features of the Card**:
- The whole Card is made clickable using the `<a>` `::after` pseudo element
- The user still has access to the context menu when right clicking on the Card
- The title is an `<h3>` so it can be used in many contexts (`<h2>` would be too limiting
- To maintain readable text within the Card on larger screen sizes, `max-width` is set to `70ch`

#### Example

```jsx
---
import { Card } from 'accessible-astro-components'
---
<ul>
  <li>
    <Card
      url="/link-to-my-post"
      img="/assets/post-cover.jpg"
      title="My Awesome Post"
      footer="Tony Stark"
    >
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
    </Card>
  </li>
  <li>
    <!-- ... -->
  </li>
</ul>

```
```scss
<style lang="scss">
  ul {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    grid-gap: 4rem;

    @media (min-width: 550px) {
      grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
      grid-gap: 2rem;
    }

    @media (min-width: 950px) {
      grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    }
  }
</style>
```

#### Overwriting styles
You can apply your own styles by either setting the individual properties using `:global(body .card)` for example, or set up a global style tag and define your styles in there:

```scss
<style lang="scss" is:global>
  body .card {
    color: purple;
    background-color: blue;

    a {
      color: gold;
    }
  }

  // set your own image height
  .card__image {
    height: 10rem;
  }
</style>
```

### DarkMode

DarkMode is a toggle button component to add and remove a class of `.darkmode` to the `<body>` based on the users preference for either a light or dark color scheme. The users preference is saved to the `localStorage` to preserve their choice for future visits.

**Some (accessibility) features of the DarkMode**:
- Utilizes `aria-pressed` to indicate to screen reader users whether the dark scheme is toggled or not
- Gives feedback to screen reader users which state is toggled using `aria-label`'s
- Uses `aria-hidden` to hide the icons for dark and light mode and uses the `aria-labels`'s instead

#### Example

```jsx
---
import { DarkMode } from 'accessible-astro-components'
---
<DarkMode />
```

```scss
<style lang="scss">
  body.darkmode {
    // define your dark color scheme
  }
</style>
```

### Media

- [When is an image descriptive](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/)

Media is a very simple component used for `<img>` tags. It has a default empty `alt` tag which is required for non-decorative images. Should the image be descriptive, for example when there's no (complementary) text, then you should always write a good descriptive `alt` tag. The Media component also utilizes the `loading="lazy"` tag to optimize performance from the browsers side.

**Some (accessibility) features of the Media**:
- Sets a default empty `alt` tag which is always required for non descriptive images.

#### Example

```jsx
---
import { Media } from 'accessible-astro-components'
---
<Media
  classes="elevation-300 radius-large"
  src="https://unsplash.com/photos/d0oYF8hm4GI"
  alt="A tiny toy astronaut, sitting on a yellow toy moon"
/>
```

### Modal

- [When (not) to use](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/modal-nonmodal-dialog/)

Modals are windows that appear on top of the parent screen, usually disabling the use of the parent screen and demanding immediate action from the user. They are pretty intrusive, so use them wisely. Though, they can be handy to confirm (destructive) actions from the user before proceeding. If you only want to communicate a notification, don't use a Modal but use the Notification component (**coming soon**) instead. Always combine the Modal with some kind of user action, for example, confirming the deletion of an item in an application. Modals are usually triggered by a `<button>`. By providing the button with an `id` you can link the button to the Modal, providing necessary functionality for opening the targeted Modal. You can also customize the text of the close Modal action using the `closeText` prop on the Modal.

**Some (accessibility) features of the Modal**:
- Closing Modal with the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key
- Trapping focus inside Modal using <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd>
- Linking the trigger element and the Modal using `id` and `aria-labbeledby`
- Setting focus back on the element that triggered the Modal after closing the Modal
- Teleporting the Modal from where you call it to the root of the `<body>`
- Exposing `closeModal()` function to use as a callback in your own JavaScript

#### Example

```jsx
---
import { Modal } from 'accessible-astro-components'
---
<button id="modal1-trigger">Modal 1</button>
<button id="modal2-trigger">Modal 2</button>

<Modal
  triggerId="modal1-trigger"
  title="Modal 1"
>
  <p>Why hello, I be the <strong>first</strong> Modal.</p>
</Modal>
<Modal
  triggerId="modal2-trigger"
  title="Modal 2"
  closeText="Cancel"
>
  <p>Ah yes, and I be the <strong>second</strong> Modal.</p>
  <!-- 
    calls the closeModal function, you can also use this 
    as a callback in your own function
  -->
  <button onclick="closeModal()">Confirm action</button>
</Modal>
```

#### Overwriting styles
You can apply your own styles by either setting the individual properties using `:global(body .modal)` for example, or set up a global style tag and define your styles in there:

```scss
<style lang="scss" is:global>
  body {
    .modal__inner {
      color: purple;
      background-color: gold;
      border-color: orange;
    }

    .modal__content {
      gap: 1.5rem;
      padding: 1rem;
    }

    .modal__close button {
      background-color: blue;

      &:hover,
      &:focus {
        background-color: green;
      }
    }
  }
</style>
```

### Notification

Notifications are often used to keep the user updated about changing state on a website or application. They can also be used as a general way to display some highlighted information in an article for example. There are two rules of thumb when it comes to Notifications and those are to always add contextual information about the Notification (such as starting with "Tip:", "Info:", "Error:") and when adding a Notification to the DOM in response to a user action, you should always use`role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` tot inform screen reader users. To add some extra visuals you can combine the Notification component with [Astro Icon](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon).

**Some (accessibility) features of the Notification**:
- Use color to identify the type of Notification (info, success, warning, error)
- Provide contextual feedback besides just color by mentioning what type of Notification is displayed
- Help identify content to screen reader users with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`

#### Example

```jsx
---
import { Notification } from 'accessible-astro-components'
---
<Notification
  type="info"
>
  <p><strong>Info:</strong> This is a notification of type info.</p>
</Notification>

<!-- example using Astro Icon -->
<Notification
  type="info"
>
  <Icon pack="ion" name="information-circle-outline" /><p><strong>Info:</strong> This is a notification of type info.</p>
</Notification>

<!-- when added to the DOM after a user interaction -->
<Notification
  type="info"
  role="status"
  aria-live="polite"
>
  <p><strong>Info:</strong> This is a notification of type info.</p>
</Notification>
```

#### Overwriting styles
You can apply your own styles by either setting the individual properties using `:global(body .notification)` for example, or set up a global style tag and define your styles in there:

```scss
<style lang="scss" is:global>
  body {
    .notification {
      color: var(--neutral-900, #202427);
      background-color: var(--neutral-200, #f6f8f9);
      border: 2px solid var(--neutral-600, #858d93);

      &.type-info {
        color: var(--info-900, #035486);
        background-color: var(--info-100, #e0f7ff);
        border-color: var(--info-600, #1a91d1);
      }

      &.type-success {
        color: var(--success-900, #014b3e);
        background-color: var(--success-100, #eefcf6);
        border-color: var(--success-500, #28a980);
      }

      &.type-warning {
        color: var(--warning-900, #8e2a0b);
        background-color: var(--warning-100, #fffbeb);
        border-color: var(--warning-600, #dc901e);
      }

      &.type-error {
        color: var(--error-900, #5e0317);
        background-color: var(--error-100, #ffe0e0);
        border-color: var(--error-500, #df2a39);
      }
    }
  }
</style>
```

### Pagination

A fairly simple yet effective Pagination component which has a first, previous, next, and last page button. It also tells the user how many pages there are and what page they are currently on. The Pagination component is also fully accessible and keyboard navigable.

**Some (accessibility) features of the Pagination**:
- Uses `aria-label`'s to tell the user whether they will go to the previous or next page and which page number
- Uses `aria-hidden` to hide the icons for the previous and next pages
- Disables the first and previous page buttons when on the first page
- Disables the last and next page buttons when on the last page

#### Example

```jsx
---
import { Pagination } from 'accessible-astro-components'
---
<Pagination 
  firstPage="/1"
  previousPage="/4"
  nextPage="/6"
  lastPage="/10"
  currentPage="/5"
  totalPages="10"
/>
```

#### Example using Astro's [Dynamic Pages](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/astro-pages#dynamic-pages)

```jsx
---
import { Pagination } from 'accessible-astro-components'

export async function getStaticPaths({ paginate }) {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
  const data = await response.json()

  return paginate(data, { pageSize: 6 })
}

const { page } = Astro.props
---
<Pagination 
  firstPage={page.url.prev ? '/blog' : null}
  previousPage={page.url.prev ? page.url.prev : null}
  nextPage={page.url.next ? page.url.next : null}
  lastPage={page.url.next ? `/blog/${Math.round(page.total / page.size)}` : null}
  currentPage={page.currentPage}
  totalPages={Math.round(page.total / page.size)}
/>
```

#### Overwriting styles
You can apply your own styles by either setting the individual properties using `:global(body .pagination)` for example, or set up a global style tag and define your styles in there:

```scss
<style lang="scss" is:global>
  body .pagination a {
    svg path {
      stroke: gold;
    }

    &:hover,
    &:focus-visible {
      background-color: purple;

      svg path {
        stroke: white;
      }
    }

    .disabled {
      border-color: red;
      opacity: 0.1;
    }
  }
</style>
```

### SkipLinks

SkipLinks provide a way for users using assistive technologies to skip repeated content on pages to go directly to the main content of a website or application. To use this component properly, make sure you give the main content of your project an `id` of `#main-content` so the SkipLink can target it. As a fallback the SkipLink will try to target the `h1` of the page. If neither are found a warning will be logged to the console.

**Some (accessibility) features of the SkipLinks**:
- Let's assistive technologies skip to the main navigation and main content of a website

#### Example

```jsx
---
import { SkipLink } from 'accessible-astro-components'
---
<SkipLinks />
```

#### Overwriting styles
You can apply your own styles by either setting the individual properties using `:global(body .skiplinks)` for example, or set up a global style tag and define your styles in there:

```scss
<style lang="scss" is:global>
  body .skiplinks a {
    color: white;
    background-color: purple;

    &:hover
    &:focus {
      background-color: indigo;
    }
  }
</style>
```
